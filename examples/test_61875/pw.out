     Parallel version (MPI), running on     1 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     Reading input from pw.inp

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3
     Presently no symmetry can be used with electric field

     Message from routine cell_base_init:
     DEPRECATED: use true lattice parameter, not A to a.u. conversion factor
     file In.UPF: wavefunction(s)  5S renormalized

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :

     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want


     gamma-point specific algorithms are used

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used
