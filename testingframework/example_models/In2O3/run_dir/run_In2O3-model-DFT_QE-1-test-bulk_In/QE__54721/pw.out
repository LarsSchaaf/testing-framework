     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     Reading input from pw.inp

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10

     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3
     Message from routine cell_base_init:
     DEPRECATED: use true lattice parameter, not A to a.u. conversion factor

     Please, verify this is what you really want


     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used

     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead

Another transport will be used instead, although this may result in
lower performance.
